Implementation of Chatbot using NLP 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an intelligent chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deploying it using Streamlit. The chatbot is designed to understand and respond to user queries using advanced NLP techniques, making interactions more natural and efficient.

## Features
- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Recognizes user intent and extracts key information.
- **Machine Learning-Based Responses:** Uses pre-trained models for improved accuracy.
- **Customizable & Scalable:** Easily adaptable for different use cases like customer support, FAQs, and automation.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple web-based UI built using Streamlit.
- **Deployment Ready:** Can be hosted on cloud platforms like Streamlit Cloud.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **NLP Libraries:** NLTK
- **Frameworks:** Rasa, Dialogflow, BotPress
- **Deployment:** Streamlit, Streamlit Cloud

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/chatbot-nlp.git
   cd chatbot-nlp
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**  
   ```sh
   python -m venv chatbot_env
   source chatbot_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: chatbot_env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Chatbot Locally:**  
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Deployment on Streamlit Cloud
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/) and log in.
3. Click on **New App**, select your GitHub repository, and choose `app.py` as the entry point.
4. Click **Deploy** and wait for the app to go live.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Gather conversational data for training.
2. **Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
3. **Model Training:** Using ML-based or Deep Learning models for intent recognition.
4. **Testing & Validation:** Evaluate the chatbot's accuracy and fine-tune the model.
5. **Deployment:** Deploy the chatbot using Streamlit for a web-based UI.
